At the core of graphIQal lies the goal of capturing what we're calling our brain's "native language". It is only in this situation, where we can see things in front of us the way our brain sees them, that we can produce at our maximum potential. So, it is imperative first to understand what it is that our brain "sees".

#

Our brain breaks down information into two components: concepts, (or **nodes**), and **connections** between them. I'll be using these two terms from now on.

#

### First, what is a Node?

It can be an experience, a thought, a feeling, a piece of knowledge, or a current snapshot of your brain state.

#

It's a _recursively deep entity_: if a node that exists in your brain is something like the concept of psychology, it entails nodes within itself, and each of these is its own recursively deep entity. The term "recursively deep" might be confusing; think of a box in a box in a box. If each of these boxes is a node, our brain treats each of these sub-boxes as a node of its own, that can be manipulated, edited, and abstracted as its own entity.

### How are nodes placed?

#

Short answer? Pretty randomly in your head, in a fairly complicated neural network. Due to this randomness, concepts in our mind are accessed much like nodes of a graph.

#

In a graph, disconnected nodes are inaccessible; it is through edges, or lines between nodes, that we can reach all of its elements. So to understand how nodes are placed and accessed, let's tackle perhaps a better question: _how are these nodes connected?_

#

Psychologists think of ideas as nodes in a vast network, where each idea is linked to many others. There are different types of links: causes are linked to their effects (virus → cold); things to their properties (lime → green); things to the categories to which they belong (banana → fruit); things to themselves at a different stage in time (final draft → rough draft).

#

Our brains have **countless** ways to connect and place this information, which, ironically, lies in stark contrast to modern technology, where everything is organized into folders and categories.

#

In psychology, there is a theory, called the conceptual metaphor theory, that argues that our brain doesn't merely use metaphors to express "literal" thoughts: we instead think in the language of metaphors. But what are metaphors, really? They're connections between conceptual skeletons.

#

_Our brain thinks in terms of connections._

#

### Making Connections: the Process and the Implications

#

The process of making these connections in our brain is way more powerful than we might realize.

#

An idea that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It activates many ideas, each of which in turn activate others– an exponential effect. Furthermore, only a few of the activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves. In _Thinking Fast and Slow_, psychologist Daniel Kahneman describes this structure:

#

"_The notion that we have limited access to the workings of our minds is difficult to accept because, naturally, it is alien to our experience, but it is true: you know far less about yourself than you feel you do._"

#

Naturally, capturing these connections that are firing in your brain is a difficult task. But I argue that this is a powerful process, a process worth capturing. So what do we get from connecting things "better"?

#

First and foremost, we get enhanced, deeper **understanding**. We can arrange, filter, and manipulate concepts based on the connections between them. But there's a whole other world unleashed as well: the world of **creativity**.

#

In order to be creative, the concepts that will give way to original ideas have to be present in your head already. As neuroscientist and professor Andrew Huberman put it, "we must forage for information in order to be creative".

#

In essence, the way we come up with something new and truly creative is through making a connection between two concepts in our brains that haven't ever been connected before.
This view of creativity has been explored by many experts. Let's take a look at some concrete examples.

#

#### Range: "Stumbling" Upon Insights

#

In the book _Range_, author David Epstein argues that our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.

#

Consider the anecdote below:

#

"_Claude Shannon launched the Information Age thanks to a philosophy course he took to fulfill a requirement at the University of Michigan. In it, he was exposed to the work of self-taught nineteenth-century English logician George Boole, who assigned a value of 1 to true statements and 0 to false statements and showed that logic problems could be solved like math equations. It resulted in absolutely nothing of practical importance until seventy years after Boole passed away, when Shannon did a summer internship at AT&T's Bell Labs research facility. There he recognized that he could combine telephone call-routing technology with Boole's logic system to encode and transmit any type of information electronically. It was the fundamental insight on which computers rely. "It just happened that no one else was familiar with both those fields at the same time," Shannon said."_

#

_Range_ is stacked full of anecdotes about this very topic: unexpected "epiphanies" of creativity that result from traversing a certain "edge"– or connection between nodes in your mind– that hasn't been traversed before. Epstein explains that this ability to "broaden our horizons" is imperative to innovation. Think of all the concepts present in your brain already, from each of your experiences, conversations, readings, etc. By pure math, it is likely that a vast majority of the edges present are yet to be explored. And by pure probability, it's likely that at least a few may lead to something **big**.

#

#### Originals: the Idea of "Vuja de"

#

In _Originals_, Adam Grant explains the idea of "Vuja de": the opposite of deja vu. In "Vuja de", we face something similar, but we see it with a fresh perspective that enables us to gain new insights into old problems. In an example of this, he explains:

#

"_Most papers relied purely on conventional combinations of previous knowledge. That is, they cited work from other journals that often appeared together in other studies' lists of references. The "hit" papers, those that over the next decade were used by a huge number of other scientists, featured ample conventional combinations, but also added an injection of unusual knowledge combinations._"

#

Here, again, we see the same idea: novelty in innovation is merely novelty in combination; and all of this is based on a deep understanding of and ability to connect the nodes present in your mind.

#

The key takeaway, from all this, is an introduction to the power, importance, and potential of the _connection_. This is what graphIQal explores.

#

"_If we could understand the 'physics of concepts', then we could perhaps derive from it the 'chemistry of creativity'._"
