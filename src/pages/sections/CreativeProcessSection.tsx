While Email can send a letter across the world instantaneously, there is nothing fundamentally different about that letter than if it was scribed in paper and ink. While I can type at 143 words per minute on Microsoft Word (😎), the product is not something unproducible in the 1500’s.\n\n Our organisation system is literally just files & folders… but on the computer. While we’ve come a long way from papyrus, our work is still well… pages pieced together ~~in a linear fashion.~~'

What could we improve if our tools weren’t bounded by the box of silly little physics? \n\n Being tech natives ourselves, we felt the frustration of wanting to move our whiteboard nodes like in Figma, or wishing our textbooks had working links like the Internet.

          '1. Thoughts are always interconnected, each thought blooming into many others - the human mind is made for thriving in the creative chaos of creating connections, insights and content.\n\n 2. All thoughts are run through the lens of context. Resources, data, and outlines should be seen and grouped through the context they’re in. \n\n 3. Thoughts are recursively discrete. Bundle Sizes. With paper, an insight has to be bound by the chapter, which has to be bound by a book. You can’t just rip a sentence out of a physical book like some monster. \n\n 4. We learn best when we can attach new information to a foundation, to our existing mental models.'

          'Along with these shapes of thought, we found the deeper philosophies that powered Creativity and Productivity. \n\n The Knowledge-Action Gap: Most of us know what we should do to be happier, healthier, and wealthier. Our world doesn’t lack information, but it lacks ways to grapple that information, to bridge the knowledge-action gap. Use graphIQal to turn journal reflections to general timelines, to specific to-do tasks. \n\n Your second brain : During our interviews, we quickly learned what our brain is amazing at; Thriving in the creative chaos of creating connections, insights and content (This is also what people liked the most). Conversely, we also learned what was most inefficient - remembering, organising, and documenting everything (is it a surprise that people hated this part the most?). By creating an organised space to store your knowledge, we can become less stressed and more productive. \n\n Creativity : Our research into the space of creativity has shown us that groundbreaking insights are about making connections between things that aren’t usually connected. Since everyone has a unique mosaic of experiences, skills, and knowledge, we believe that within everyone lies the potential to create something entirely new!'
